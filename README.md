PROJECT-Q HYDRA
===============

Hydra is an open-source tactical coordination machine that connects heterogeneous sensors
and command systems into a unified internet of defense network.
It provides real-time sensor fusion, automated track correlation,
and coordinated response workflows - without replacing your existing systems. 

- Sensor Fusion: Correlate tracks from sensors
- Multi-Domain: Single architecture for CUAS, ground surveillance, and maritime awareness 
- DDIL-Native: Peer-to-peer mesh continues operating when disconnected 
- API-First: Every capability accessible via REST/gRPC; integrate in hours, not months
